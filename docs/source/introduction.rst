What is Python REST API Framework
=================================

Python REST API framework is a set of utilities based on werkzeug to
easily build Restful API. It keep a clean codebase and is easy to
configure and extends.

It does not decide how you want to render your data, or where they
lives, or other decisions.

Instead it give you a good start with an extensible architecture to
build your own API.

Python REST API Framework has not been create for the usual
case. Instead it give you some hook to your very special resource
provider, your very special view management and your very special way
of displaying data.

Python REST API Framework is fully REST compilant; It implement the
common verbs:

* GET
* POST
* UPDATE
* DELETE
* HEAD

It also implement:

* PAGINATION
* AUTHENTICATION
* RATE-LIMIT
* DATA VALIDATION
* PARTIAL RESPONSE

Architecture
------------

Python REST API Framework is base on the MVC pattern. You define some
endpoints defining a Ressource, a Controller and a View with a set of
options to configure them.


Controller
~~~~~~~~~~

Manage the way you handle request. Controller create the urls
endpoints for you. List, Unique and Autodocumented endpoints.

Controller also manage pagination, formaters, authentication,
authorization, rate-limit and allowed method.

DataStore
~~~~~~~~~

Each method of a Controller call the DataStore to interact with
data. The DataStore must be able to retreive data from a
ressource.

Each datastore act on a particular type of ressource
(database backend, api backend, csv backend etc...). It must be
able to validate data, create new ressources, update existing
ressources, manage filters and pagination.

Optional configuration option, that can be unique for a particular
datastore like Ressource level validation (unique together and so),
ForeignKey management...

View
~~~~

Views defines how the data must be send to the client. It send a
Response object and set the needed headers, mime-type and other
presentation options like formaters.


How To use it
-------------

To create as many endpoint as you need. Each endpoints defining a
ressource, a controller and a view. Then add them to the
:class:`rest_api_framework.controllers.WSGIDispatcher`

See `QuickStart` for an example or the :doc:`tutorial` for the whole picture.

QuickStart
----------

A Simple API
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this example, we will use a python list containing dicts. This is
our data:

.. code-block:: python

    ressources = [
        {"name": "bob",
        "age": a,
        "id": a
        } for a in range(100)
        ]

Then we have to describe this ressource. To describe a ressouce, you
must create a Model class inheriting from base Model class:

.. code-block:: python

   from rest_api_framework import models

   class ApiModel(models.Model):

       fields = [models.IntegerField(name="age", required=True),
                 models.StringField(name="name", required=True),
                 models.PkField(name="id")
                 ]


Each Field contain validators. When you reuse an existing Field class
you get his validators for free.

There is already a datastore to handle this type of data: PythonListDataStore.
We can reuse this store:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_api_framework.datastore import PythonListDataStore

then we need a Controller class to hanlde our API:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_api_framework.controllers import Controller

and a view to render our data

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_api_framework.views import JsonResponse


    class ApiApp(Controller):
        ressource = {
            "ressource_name": "address",
            "ressource": ressources,
            "model": ApiModel,
            "datastore": PythonListDataStore
            }

        controller = {
            "list_verbs": ["GET", "POST"],
            "unique_verbs": ["GET", "PUT", "DELETE"],
            }

        view = {"response_class": JsonResponse}

A controller is build with 3 dicts:

Ressource
_________

Ressource define your data. Where are your data ? How can they be
accessed ? What they look likes?

  * ressource_name: will be used to build the url endpoint to your
     ressource.

  * ressource: where your ressource lies.this argument tell the
     datastore how they can be accessed. It can be the database name
     and the database table for a SQL datastore or the url endpoint to
     a distant API for exemple.

  * model: describe how your data look like. Wich field it show, how
     to validate data and so on.

  * datastore: the type of your data. There is datastore for simple
     Python list of dict and SQLite datastore. They are exemple on how
     to build your own datastore depending on your needs.

Controller
__________

The controller define the way your data should be accessed. Should the
results be paginated ? Authenticated ? Rate-limited ? Wich it the
verbs you can use on the resource ? and so on.

  * list_verbs: define the verbs you can use on the main endpoint of
     your ressource. If you dont' use "POST", a user cannot create new
     ressources on your datastore.

  * unique_verbs: define the verbs you can use on the unique
     identifier of the ressource. actions depending on the verbs
     follows the REST implementation: PUT to modify an existing
     ressource, DELETE to delete a ressource.

View
____

view define How your ressoources should be rendered to the
user. It can be a Json format, XML, or whatever. It can also
render pagination token, first page, last page, number of objects
and other usefull informations for your users.

  * response_class: the response class you use to render your data.

To test you application locally, you can add:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from werkzeug.serving import run_simple
        from rest_api_framework.controllers import WSGIDispatcher
        app = WSGIDispatcher([ApiApp])
        run_simple('127.0.0.1', 5000, app, use_debugger=True, use_reloader=True)

then type "python app.py" and your API is up and running

Options
_______

Each of this dicts can take an optional parameter: "option". This
parameter is a dict containing all the options you want to use with
either the datastore, the view or the controller.

You can learn more about optional parameters in the documentation of
each topic : :doc:`datastore`, :doc:`view`, :doc:`controller`


Using a database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using a python dict, you may want to actualy save your data
in a database. To do so, you just have to change your datastore and
define your ressources in a way SQL datastore can understand.

SQLiteDataStore use sqlite3 as database backend. ressources will be a
dict with database name and table name. The rest of the configuration
is the same as with the PythonListDataStore.

.. note::

  if the sqlite3 database does not exist, REST API Framework create it for you

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_api_framework.datastore import SQLiteDataStore
    from rest_api_framework.controllers import Controller
    from rest_api_framework.views import JsonResponse
    from rest_api_framework import models
    from rest_api_framework.pagination import Pagination

    class ApiModel(models.Model):
        fields = [models.StringField(name="message", required=True),
                  models.StringField(name="user", required=True),
                  models.PkField(name="id", required=True),
                  ]

    class ApiApp(Controller):
        ressource = {
           "ressource_name": "tweets",
           "ressource": {"name": "twitter.db", "table": "tweets"},
           "datastore": SQLiteDataStore,
           "model": ApiModel
        }
        controller = {
           "list_verbs": ["GET", "POST"],
           "unique_verbs": ["GET", "PUT", "DELETE"]
           "options": {"pagination": Pagination(20)}
        }
        view = {"response_class": JsonResponse}


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from werkzeug.serving import run_simple
        from rest_api_framework.controllers import WSGIDispatcher
        app = WSGIDispatcher([ApiApp])
        run_simple('127.0.0.1', 5000, app, use_debugger=True, use_reloader=True
